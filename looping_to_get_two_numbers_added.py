#(Validating User Input) Modify the script of Fig. 3.3 to validate its inputs. 
#For any input, if the value entered is other than 1 or 2, keep looping until the user enters a correct
#value. Use one counter to keep track of the number of passes, then calculate the number
#of failures after all the userâ€™s inputs have been received.
